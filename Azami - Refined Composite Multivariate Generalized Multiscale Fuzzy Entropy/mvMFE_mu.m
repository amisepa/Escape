function Out_mvMFE=mvMFE_mu(X,sm,sr,n,stau,Scale)
% This function calculates multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE) whose
% coarse-graining is based on mean
%
%
% Inputs:
% X: multivariate signal - a matrix of size nvar (the number of channels) x nsamp (the number of sample points for each channel)
% sm: scalar embedding value
% sr: scalar threshold value (it is usually equal to 0.15)
% n: fuzzy power (it is usually equal to 2)
% stau: scalar time lag  value (it is usually equal to 1)
% Scale: the number of scale factors
%
% Output:
% Out_mvMFE: a scalar quantity

% Because multi-channel signals may have different amplitude ranges, the distances calculated on embedded vectors may be biased
%toward the largest amplitude ranges variates. For this reason, we scale all the data channels to the same amplitude range and
% we normalize each data channel to unit standard deviation so that the total variation becomes equal to the number of channels
% or variables [1].
